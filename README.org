** Requirements
To run the network simulation a Python 3 environment with Brian 2, Pypet and . Git is also required to be installed.

Any recent version of [[https://github.com/brian-team/brian2][Brian 2]] should work. However, to run very long simulations a fix discussed in [[https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/pull/1057][#1057]] is required.

Below is a recommended installation routine setting up a virtualenv. You may 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh

virtualenv -p python3 /home/fh/env/synsrv
source /home/fh/env/synsrv/bin/activate

# Brian 2 branch that fixes bug for long simulations
pip install -e git+https://github.com/brian-team/brian2@355cbf98061f2ae4c4afdc1600f363c5d8c0979d#egg=Brian2

pip install mrestimator==0.1.5
pip install elephant==0.6.0

pip install tables==3.5.1
pip install pypet==0.4.3

# pip install gitdb2==2.0.5
# pip install GitPython==2.1.11

pip install GitPython
#+END_SRC


** Installation

Get the 

: git clone  --recurse-submodules https://github.com/synsrv/src_net





** Run a simulation
To verify 

# Run for example as

# #+BEGIN_SRC 
# ./run.sh 10 14 32GB
# #+END_SRC

# where 10 is the number simultaneous runs, 14 is the number of cores requested on the cluster, and 32GB is the requested memory.
